<p class="BannerPrint">The Apex2Avalara SDK is an Apex Class Library that exposes class methods (APIs) to enable calling the 
Avalara Sales Tax Calculation and Address Validation Web Services.
<br /><br />
The APIs are all encapsulated in the AVASFSDK namespace, and are further broken down into the AddressSvc and TaxSvc classes, which are containers for the AddressSvcSoap and TaxSvcSoap proxy classes, as well as all
supporting data structures (classes), such as GetTaxRequest, and ValidateRequest.
<br /><br />
The Address Service APIs are exposed as methods of the AVASFSDK.AddressSvc.AddressSvcSoap proxy class, and the Tax Service APIs 
as methods of the AVASFSDK.TaxSvc.TaxSvcSoap proxy class.
